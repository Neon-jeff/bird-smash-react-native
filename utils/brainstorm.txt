let x=40

// equation of a parabola?
// y=ax^2 + bx + c (quadratic equation which inscribes a parabola)

// points of intersection are the origin and total horizontal distance

translation_y_equation= x^2 + total_distance * x

the parabolic motion is just a graphical plot of the equation above, starting from x =0, total_distance/2, total_distance

y is maximum at x= total_distance/2
